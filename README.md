### Overview ###

  CAF brings to Angular / Ionic 5 the same functionalities that CTF (Convertigo Templating Framework)  brings to JQuery.  The goal is to add Convertigo back end support directly in to the Ionic HTML templates without having to program complex TypeScript. For example calling a Convertigo sequence from a button is as simple as that:
  
  	<button ion-button full (click)="call('.Login')">Click Me</button>
  
  CAF will automatically handle the sequence call, using the configured endpoint. Displaying data from a Sequence response, for example assuming that sequence returns a 
  
  	{
  		"login": "some data"
  	}
  
  Object, is as simple as that:
  
  	<ion-item>{{listen([".Login"])?.login}}</ion-item>
  
  See? No other TypeScript to Write !
  
  CAF also handles forms easily. To submit a form to a Convertigo sequence (for example "Login") just use:
  
  	<form (ngSubmit)="call('.Login')">
  		....
  		<input type="text" [(ngModel)]="form.user">
  		....
  		<input type="text" [(ngModel)]="form.password">
  		...
  		<button type="submit">
  	</form>
  
  The login sequence will be called and automatically will receive a 'user' and a 'password' variable populated by the user input.
